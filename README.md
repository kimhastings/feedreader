# Feedreader - Unit Testing using Jasmine

## Introduction

This project was created as an assignment for the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program. It is a simple RSS feed reader that watches several Udacity feeds. I have added a number of tests using Jasmine. The test results are shown at the bottom of the feed reader page.

## How to Use the Feed Reader

Download the repository to your computer using the green "Clone or Download" button. Unzip the download and then open index.html in your browser. Alternatively, you can open a hosted version of the feed reader by clicking [here](https://kimhastings.github.io/feedreader/).

You can switch which feed is displayed by using the menu (aka "hamburger") icon in the upper left corner.
