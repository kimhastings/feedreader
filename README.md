# Feedreader - Unit Testing using Jasmine

## Introduction

This project was created as an assignment for the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program. It is a simple RSS feed reader that watches several Udacity feeds. I have added a number of tests using Jasmine. The test results are shown at the bottom of the feed reader page.
